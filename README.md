2. Go to Extensions (you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Dorothy Time" and install it.
4. Restart Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

- The time tracking starts automatically once the extension is installed.
- The time spent on the currently focused file is displayed in the status bar at the bottom.
